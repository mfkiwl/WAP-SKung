# WAP-SKung (Work in Progress)
Code for S.Kung's paper on Wavefront Array Processors

This code reproduces the paper, http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1663617/ by Sun Yuan Kung. The implementation is then modified to process a recurrent neural network using a wavefront array processor.

## Deployment Platform
- Xilinx Nexys4 DDR board

## Tutorial
- Coming soon
